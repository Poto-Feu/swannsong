cs_welcome_1 "Hej ! So you wanna play Swannsong Adventure, huh ? Well, I'll let you know that this is a qualit√§t game. You won't regret playing it."
cs_welcome_2 "You play as Vladimir Swann, a regular man who absolutely wants to get the deluxe edition of the soundtrack album of \"Tolstoi and his brothers\". Anyway, I hope that you will appreciate this game made by a student who just started to learn C++ (and who isn't a native english speaker)."
