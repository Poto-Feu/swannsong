        <h1>Save file format</h1>
        <p>The save file is a binary file divided into 3 parts:<p>
        <ul>
            <li>Header</li>
            <li>Chunks</li>
            <li>Checksum</li>
        </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>Header</h2>
            <p>The header contains several elements in the following order:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A 4-char program signature (SWSA)</li>
                <li>A 4-char file type signature (SAVE)</li>
                <li>A 16-bit unsigned int storing file type major version</li>
                <li>A 16-bit unsigned int storing file type minor version</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Chunks</h2>
            <p>A save file chunk is composed of several elements in the following order:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A 16-bit unsigned int enum value corresponding to the chunk type - enum values
                    are defined in save_const.hpp</li>
                <li>A 32-bit unsigned int value corresponding to the size of the chunk content</li>
                <li>Content bits</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There is no separator between chunks since their size is specified.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Checksum</h2>
            <p>A SHA-1 checksum is calculated from the file data (including the header) to check
            its integrity. It is appended at the end of the save file.</p>
